Grocery Management System
==================

This project was developed as part of the Object Oriented Programming Practice Lab (COM104P), IIITD&M Kancheepuram. 

The Grocery Management System has the following features :
* To simulate Grocery Market operations of Purchasing, Maintaining of products and Billing the customers.
* To keep the store owner informed when a particular product stock reaches its threshold minimum.
* To store a complete log history of the operations to view and search them whenever necessary.
* Two operational modes : Administrator and User (Customer)

The following concepts was well understood and implemented in the project :
* Design of the system
* Object-oriented Programming ( Classes and Objects )
* File Manipulation ( Random Access and Sequential Access )
* Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Unit and Integration Testing

There is no database used. All the records are stored in a flat file and manipulated using the C++ File API.
